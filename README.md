# Webpack Express Example App

This app is getting a url from the U.I. and sends it to an API where it is validated to return some of the texts characteristics. 

It is using Webpack, Express and Jest.

It has been made by Dio Papadopoulos as part of a Udacity course for front end development.
It has been particularly annoying, as is everything when you are not reading the instructions well before working on it.
I will not start describing the frustration of making this run with Webpack5. But now it is done! :)
